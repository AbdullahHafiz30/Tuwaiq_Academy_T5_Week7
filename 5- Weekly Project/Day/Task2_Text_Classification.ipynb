Check the columns, data types, and a few sample entries. This helps to ensure that the data is loaded correctly and gives you an initial overview of the content.\n","\n","2. **Check for Missing Values**:\n","   Identify if there are any missing values in the dataset.\n","\n","3. **Distribution of Labels**:\n","   Examine the distribution of the target labels (classes).\n","\n","4. **Text Data Characteristics (Bonus)**:\n","   Analyze the length of the text data. It is useful to calculate the number of words or characters in each text sample to understand how long the texts are.
